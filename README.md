# Emoji Coords

A silly attempt at doing a single-emoji coordinate system for EMFCamp using space-filling curves to try and keep similar emoji near each other.

You should be able to just run `view.html` on a checkout to see it, but
be aware that it's misusing the main EMF map assets and so it may not work
until you zoom in and out a bit. Please don't do that yourself.
